## 2. Wall thickness

| requirement  | parameter(mm) |
| --- | --- |
| keep strength | >2.0 |
| keep the appearance | >0.8 |
| the minimum  thickness | >0.4 | 
There are different thickness walls. After checking the appearance and strength. Designer should make sure the thickness bigger than the above parameter or the model might have risk.






## 3. Column

We need at least following parameter to keep  enough strength:

  * The diameter of round column at least 2.5mm;
  * The size of square column at least  3mm*3mm

If the parameter less than the above parameter, the model may failure:

* For blue part in the above picture
    *  Scraper may broke the model before solidify the next layer of model;
    * The vibration of ultrasonic cleaning machine may broken the model;
    * Some small accident during transport may  broken the model;
* For yellow part in the above picture: The model would bend because of outside environment;



## 4. Hole

* The diameter of round hole should be at least 1.2mm, or the hole may close off;
*  The size of square hole  should be at least 1mm, or the hole may close off.

In addition, the 3D printing hole would be a little small than design. If designer has requirement in size, engineer and designer can use machine to enlarge it.

## 5. Text

The laser of SLA machine has minimum laser spot size. So the heigh of model need safety value( the minimum text height )

|  Limit value(mm)  | Safety value(mm) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embossed text | 3 | 4 |
| Engraved text | 2.5 | 4 |


## 6. Bridge

The safety value should  be less than 8mm, or we need support for bridge
## 7. Overhang angle

Normal ,the overhang angle over 40 in model should add support, but we don't need support in this model  because it is short and thick

## 8. Cone

<font color=red size=30>I need support to measure it </font>

## 9. Circle
In prototype measure, almost every direction would scale for 99%.

## 10. Groove

| Width\Thickness | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.8 | 1.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.9 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.8 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.7 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.6 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.5 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.4 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.3 | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| 0.2 | NO | NO  | NO  | NO |
| 0.1 | NO | NO | NO | NO  |
The conclusion is width bigger than 0.3mm, thickness bigger than0.2mm.
