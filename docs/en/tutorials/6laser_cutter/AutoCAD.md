# Auto CAD 
## 1. What is Auto CAD
AutoCADÂ® is computer-aided design (CAD) software that architects, engineers, and construction professionals rely on to create precise 2D and 3D drawings.

Draft, annotate, and design 2D geometry and 3D models with solids, surfaces, and mesh objects
Automate tasks such as comparing drawings, addings blocks, creating schedules, and more
Customize with add-on apps and APIs

## 5. Input fusion data to AutoCAD


* Create standard 2D drawings from your 3D geometry by entering the DRAWING workspace. See the Drawings section of the help for more information.
* Choice Drawing>from design
* In creating drawing,we can determine the size and other information , I choice IOS standard, unit is mmsheet size A4,etc
* Output from dxf formate and then open in AutoCAD
